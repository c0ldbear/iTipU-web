# Learn TDD with iTipU project

Nice that you want to learn Test-Driven Development (TDD)! Here you find a simple app that can help you calculate the amount of your bill when you want to add a tip! It (should) calculate the amount when there is a tip added and the total amount when taxes are applied too. 

## Assignment
The project contains a View with properties (constant values), and it is **your task** with TDD to implement a View Model that helps the view calculate the Bill Amount + Tip and the Total Amount (Bill Amount + Tip + Taxes/VAT). 

## Instructions

Clone this project, and check out the `start` branch - this is where you will start working.

```bash
git clone <correct url/ssh path>

git checkout start
```

Use TDD methodology when solving the task. Remember: Write the test, let it fail, write the code that needs to pass the test and repeat, see image below.

This project uses `yarn` as a package manager, so to get started:

```bash
yarn install
```

then

```bash
yarn dev
```

To run the test suit (in branch `start`):
```bash
yarn test
```
